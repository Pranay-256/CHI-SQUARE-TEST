# CHI-SQUARE-TEST

The Chi-Square Test is a statistical tool used to examine relationships between categories in your data, rather than comparing averages (like the T-test or Z-test).

Key Idea
The Chi-Square Test primarily asks: "Are these two things related, or are the observations purely random?"

When to Use It
You use this test when your data can be counted and placed into categories (or "bins"), such as:

Gender (Male/Female) and Opinion (Yes/No).

Product Type (A/B/C) and Customer Rating (Good/Bad).

How It Works (Conceptually)It compares the Observed Counts (what you actually measured) to the Expected Counts (what you would expect to see if there were no relationship between the categories).It calculates the $\chi^2$ statistic based on the differences between these Observed and Expected counts.A large $\chi^2$ value means there is a large discrepancy between what you saw and what you expected by chance alone.If the $\chi^2$ value is large enough, you conclude the relationship or pattern is statistically significant—meaning the two categories are genuinely related.
